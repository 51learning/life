## Cloud Native Infrastructure

QingTian is designed for powerful Cloud native infrastructure with Zero Losses. It uses software-hardware synergy technologies to provide enterprises with cloud-native infrastructure that delivers the optimal performance, cost-effectiveness, and experience.

1.  Unified and Flexible resources pools of Bare-Metal Servers, Virtual machines, and Containers.
2.  40% high performance. cloud-native storage pools allow storage resources to be quickly and automatically allocated, scaled, and migrated based on container requirements. This provides secure, reliable, and high-performance data management capabilities for stateful applications.
3.  30% cost reduction. innovative container offloading technology based on the QingTian architecture greatly improves the container cluster resource utilization and reduces the resource costs by 30%.
4.  Fast Scaling as per the business workload requirements, Provisioning of 1000 containers in seconds.
