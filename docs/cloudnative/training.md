### Doubt

5 - Build Agnostic k8s and provision on CCE (OKD exemple) 

CCE is based on opensource k8s platform, what's real requirement about this item?


8 - Gateway application (APIG)

9 - API Console operation (Use openAPI)

Does the customer currently use its own APIG? The customer is interested in Huawei APIG. Do you want to know about Huawei APIG operations?
